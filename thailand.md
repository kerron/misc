## Krabi,

This is quite popular so I didn't stay there too long. Instead I suggest taking a short boat ride over to Tonsai.

## Tonsai

Recommended Time: 1 Day
Things to do: Relax, smoke/mushroom, drink, scenic, banana bread

Tonsai is only accessible by boat, but when you get there is it very beautiful with some bars on the shore, wooden cottages in the hills, and limestone mountains surrounding you.
When you arrive on the island there's a Jamaican-theme bar on the far left. It's super-chilled, with some slacklining, cocktails, (free) smoke, food and very welcoming people.
At the other end there's a bar that does mushroom shakes. If you happen to be here at night, it worth sharing a shake with your partner. Very beautiful experience.
There's a stall there which sells banana bread. If you're luckly she'll still have one available. It's the best banana bread you'll probably ever have.

## Koh Tao

Things to do: snorkelling, swim, relax, massage, watch fire-shows, romantic dinner, dance, scenic
Recommended Time: Forever, Keep left when you get off the boat.

Koh Tao is by far one of the the most beautiful places I've ever been. They say Hoi An (Vietnam) is one of the most romantic places, but it doesn't come close to Koh Tao. It's really hard not to be happy here and in awe of just how great life can be.

It's only accessible by boat. When you get on the island there'll be loads of drivers trying to take you to your hostel/hotel. That's not necessary. The island is so small you could probably stroll and finish it in a day.

Instead, check on google maps and walk to your hostel/hotel. You'll see loads of beautiful things along the way.

You should both get a massage one evening before dinner. There are a few restaurants I would recommend for a romantic night. There's also fireworks, parties and fire dances every night on the beach. You can literally just drink on the beach all day and not have to move more than a few meters to get all your needs met.

You'll have a great time here.

## Koh Phangnan

Things to do: water slide, sunset bar, full-moon party, pool parties, hang out with locals, scenic
Recommended time: 2 Full Days

If you're in Koh Tao, then it's worth visiting Koh Phangnan as well. This is where they have the infamous Full-moon party. I've never been as I'm not that good with loads of people. However, it one of the biggest party in Thailand, and probably in the world. It's infamous.
Apart from that there's so much more to do on this island.

It has an amazing water slide which is a must visit if you're there. It's extremely tall and scary, but so much fun. Must visit.
There's a restaurant on the island which is the most spectacular views you'll ever see at a restuarant. It's on a hill so high up that some vehicles can't drive up.

Know what you're doing before you get there. If you're in a happy mood you might actually consider proposing - it's that romantic.
There's an infinity pool there as well that you can have cocktails in and watch the sunset.
If you find a better resturant than this, let me know.

I have some history here, so if you going let me know and I'll get some locals to show you a good time, where to stay, etc.

## Bangkok,

Things to do: everything
Recommended time: 1 night
Ha! This place. If you want some advice I will recommend you offline.

I recommend spending time south and exploring the island instead though, as you will feel short-changed if you only spend a day in Bangkok
