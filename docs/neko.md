# Neko

## Why?

London is one of the most diverse capitals in the world. It is filled with people from all types of professional disciplines, skills, interests, and has an abundance of opportunities.

Yet London is also one of the loneliest places to live.

It's not always obvious that we share so much with the people we past on our daily commute, during our coffee breaks, or simply waiting in line at the grocery store. Yet these little crossings that govern our daily life could also offer us with many opportunities.

We could be missing out on finding our next business partner, mentor, wedding photographer, designer, (etc) during these daily crossings.

Instead we search behind a screen to connect with someone across the world, when we could already share many interests and skills with the person sitting next to us.

These lack of real social connections make people feel lonely in a city as vibrant and opportunistic as London.

So what's a better way to solve this?

## How

There are endless possibilities of meeting the right people as we carry out our daily lives.

The advent of social media means that we share more and more with people. However, this has not necessarily led to more meaningful relationships, due to the lack of physical interactions we have, and real social value it adds.

Neko utilises information you are happy to share to form meaningful, and real-time, relationships with the people around you.

## What

Neko is a location-base mobile application that allows you to easily speak to the people around you.

You do this through information you are happy to share on your public Profile.

You can write anything on your profile and have it go everywhere with you. You can see it as having the biggest promotional banner with you all the time, to showcase your skills, interests, and to promote yourself just the way you want.

Your profile is a very effective way to show off who you are, your skills, profession and interests.

This provide other people using the app with enough information to start a meaningful conversation about things that really specific and matter to you.

People are recommended to you based on their relative proximity, profession, and interests, making it easy to meet like-minded people. You decide what skills or interests you would like to know about, and we will tell you when youâ€™re around this person. This means you can initiate a conversation on meaningful topics without feeling awkward or intrusive.

By using the app you get to say all the right things and at the right times. People notice you, and for the right things.

Neko gives you the opportunity to build prosperous engagements all in real time.

## How it works

You will be able to login using one of the major sign-in methods (i.e. Google, Facebook, etc). This will take you to your accounts page where you are able to update your profile, specify your interests, profession, and what you would like to be notified about.

![profile](https://github.com/kerron/neko/blob/master/images/profile.png)  
The main screen shows a list of all the people you have crossed paths with within a certain proximity. Each profile card shows some information about the person, number of similar interests you share, a profile picture, and more.

If a user has sent a connection request or a message, this will be notified to you via the sidebar, along with a notification icon on the top right corner of the user's profile cards.

Clicking on a user's card allows you to see more information about that person, where you crossed paths, connection request, their skills, and more. You can request to connect with this person (or accept a connection request if sent) from the profile screen. The user first needs to accept your connection request before you can send a message.

A business may send you an exclusive badge. This will first show up as a notification in the app, on which you can click to view more details. You have the option to accept or reject the badge. Badges are use to show exclusivity and represent a small number of people.
