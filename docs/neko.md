# Neko

## Why?

London is one of the most diverse capitals in the world. It is filled with people from all types of professional disciplines, skills, interests, and has an abundance of opportunities.

It's not always obvious that we share so much with the people we past on our daily commute, during our coffee breaks, or simply waiting in line at the grocery store. Yet these little crossings that govern our daily life could also offer us with many opportunities.

We could be missing out on finding our next business partner, mentor, wedding photographer, designer, (etc) during these daily crossings.

Instead we search behind a computer screen to connect with someone across the world, when we could already share many interests and skills with the person sitting next to us.

So what's a better way to solve this?

## How

There are endless possibilities of meeting the right people as we carry out our daily lives.

The advent of social media means that we share more and more with people. However, this has not necessarily led to more meaningful relationships, due to the lack of physical interactions we have, and real social value it adds.

Neko utilises information you are happy to share to form meaningful, and real-time, relationships with the people around you.

## What

Neko is a location-base mobile application that allows you to easily speak to the people around you.

You do this through information you are happy to share on your public Profile.

You can write anything on your profile and have it go everywhere with you. You can see it as having the biggest promotional banner with you all the time, to showcase your skills, profession, and interests.

This provide other people using the app with enough information to start a meaningful conversation about things that are specific and important to you.

People are recommended to you based on their relative proximity, profession, and interests, making it easy to meet like-minded people. You decide what skills or interests you would like to know about, and we will tell you when youâ€™re around this person. This means you can initiate a conversation on meaningful topics without feeling awkward or intrusive.

Neko gives you the opportunity to say all the right things at the right time and build high value relationships.
All in real time.
