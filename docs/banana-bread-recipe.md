# Banana bread recipe

## Ingredients

150g self-raising flour
100g butter (usually salted-butter)
2 eggs (including yoke)
50g raisins
3 shots of bourbon|brandy|rum
80g caster sugar
3 bananas

**Optional**:
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

You already know the steps for making it, so I won't mention everything, but I:

- bake for 35minutes at 200 degrees Celsius
- soak the raisins in the spirit over night (if not, at least for a few hours).
- added the raisin-infused spirit into the batter along with the raisins.
