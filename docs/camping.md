# Camping

## Location

Cornwall

(will update with location soon)

**Date**: 24 - 27 July 2020

**Arrival Time at campsite**: 5-6pm

## What you need

- [ ] **Tent**

  My suggestion would be a 2 man tent. I recommend two below, which are very popular! The first comes ready made (pop-up), the second need a little bit of work (happy to help), but gives you extra room at the front. This extra room is useful for putting your shoes, bag, etc (I really recommend it).

  I have this tent [Vango Orion Trekking Tent, Cactus Green, 200](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vango-Orion-Trekking-Cactus-Green/dp/B01LZ8OOZW)

- [ ] Duvet (or sleeping bag)
- [ ] blowup bed (don't go too big, make sure it can fit inside your tent!)
- Pillow
- [ ] liner to go below your blow up bed. This can be something like a picnic blanket, or reflective foil if you want to go proper. It's to essentially stop the cold air from the ground getting into your bed.
- [ ] something warm like a hoodie/jacket (for walking around at nights)
- [ ] torch
- Matches/lighter
- [ ] toiletries
- [ ] towels
- [ ] toilet paper
- [ ] flip-flops/sandels
- [ ] shoes you don't mind getting dirty
- [ ] sunglasses
- [ ] Cutleries
- [ ] sharp knife
- [ ] Whatever foods/drinks you want for your time there
