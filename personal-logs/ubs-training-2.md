# UBS Training session
Meeting: UBS Training session
re:infer reps: Kerron, Cristi, George
UBS reps:  Satish Shakti, Navin Kumar, David
Objective: To go through the re:infer platform with a user from UBS
User: Satish Shakti

Satish was on the call from last meeting on Tuesday 5 March, but missed the first 30 minutes.

## Positive Feedback

- User was able to quickly understand how to show more verbatim per page.
- After initial training on how to apply labels, user was able to repeat this process relatively smoothly.
- Able to easily de/select a verbatim that does not match the label (this feature has a PR to change this behaviour using the toggle icon).

## Negative Feedback

- User mistakenly scrolled inside a verbatim instead of the screen.
- The need to double click the button to apply labels isn't obvious - user asked why it isn't a single click
- After adding individual label on a verbatim, the user clicked outside the input box (instead of the pin icon) assuming it would apply the label. Repeated action.
- User asked if it's possible to add multiple labels on a single verbatim at once using slash
- User did not always click the pin before applying bulk labels, causing him to carry out the apply action twice. Repeat action.
- Clicking the signature button causes the verbatim to disappear. User had a lot of confusion with this.
- User always typed the entire label name instead of selecting it from the drop down. Repeat action.
- After dismissing a predicted label, user wasn't aware he could add one of the remaining suggested label. I think this is because the predicted labels changed colour to an outline border only.

## Knowledge gap
